The Dummy-Robot project on GitHub by peng-zhihui is an innovative mini robotic arm designed for tech enthusiasts and developers interested in robotics and automation. The project features a super compact smart robotic arm that integrates advanced features such as C++11 for core programming enhancements, a fully decoupled hardware dependency allowing future MCU platform adaptability, and use of both CAN and UART protocols for versatile communications. The design emphasizes ease of customization and scalability, facilitating learning and adaptation for personal or educational robotics projects.

The technical focus of the Dummy-Robot includes:

Programming: Utilizes C++ with some parts in C for performance efficiency.  
Hardware Compatibility: Designed to be hardware-agnostic which simplifies porting to other MCU platforms.  
Storage: Implements simulated EEPROM for data storage that persists through power cycles.  
Control Protocols: Includes templates for CAN and UART protocols, allowing for extensive control options.  
Positioning: Features innovative zero-positioning capabilities within a half-turn for enhanced precision.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
