Hello! I am Zihan Wang, a dedicated undergraduate at Rutgers University's School of Engineering Honors Academy, studying Material Science and Engineering, as well as Applied Physics. Currently, I am deeply involved in research as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Professor Aaron Mazzeoâ€™s lab, where we are focusing on fabricating paper-based biosensors. 
Beyond my academic and research endeavors, I am passionate about photography. I use a Fujifilm XT-5 equipped with a 35mm f2 lens, capturing the subtleties of the world around me. I am also a frequent visitor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where I find endless inspiration in its vast and diverse collections. 
--Live long and prosper--
